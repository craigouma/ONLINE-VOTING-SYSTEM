# ONLINE-VOTING-SYSTEM
This code defines several functions for registering contenders and voters, verifying credentials, casting votes, and checking election results. The main function presents a menu that allows the user to choose an action to perform.
This code is for an online voting system that allows contenders to register, voters to register and cast their votes, and the election commission to check the results of the election. The system also includes various functions for verifying voter credentials, generating unique voter IDs and passwords, and keeping track of which voters have already cast their votes.

To create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, you will need to use Django templates and static files. You can create template files in the templates directory of your app and use Django's template language to include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the templates. You can also create static files in the static directory of your app and link to them in your templates.

It is not necessary to use a database for the online voting system described in the code I provided. The code uses Python dictionaries to store information about contenders and voters, and it does not need to persist this information across multiple sessions or sessions.

However, if you want to build a more robust and scalable voting system, you may want to consider using a database to store the information about contenders, voters, and votes. A database would allow you to store large amounts of data efficiently and ensure that the data is persistent and can be accessed by multiple users simultaneously.

There are many different types of databases that you can use, such as relational databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL), document-oriented databases (e.g. MongoDB), and key-value stores (e.g. Redis). You can use a database management system (DBMS) or an object-relational mapper (ORM) to interact with the database from your web application.

If you do decide to use a database for your voting system, you will need to modify the code I provided to store and retrieve data from the database using SQL or an ORM.
